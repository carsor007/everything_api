Notice
=============================================================================

This project is currently in heavy development. We are creating a rough basic
entity API first. Then we will iterate off of that and refactor commonalities
into something worth using.

Though mostly usable, it hasn't reached a production build. Also, things are
pretty naive at the moment... much refactoring needs to take place.

**Supported Entities:**

* Projects
* Applications
* Application Users
* Products
* Thngs
* Properties
* Actions
* Action Types
* Locations
* Collections
* Places


**TODO:**

* Probably need to define all Entity arguments as kwarguments?
* Complete datatype_list_of_social_networks
* Add filtering where possible (ie, list pages)
* Re-factor repeated repetative things out to keep things DRY
* Implement Service APIs
* Alias endpoints
    * */products/:productId/actions/:actionType*
    * */thngs/:thngId/actions/:actionType*
    * */collections/:collectionId/actions/:actionType*
* 'to' parameter in delete_location
* Config options singleton (so you don't have to pass api_key everywhere)
* Add usage examples
* Sphinx generated documentation
* Add pagination limit support
